# Trollbox Micro

A little, tiny plugin that you can add to your bookmarks bar that lets you enjoy Trollbox by a single button click!

Please note that there is no tutorial to use this; you'll have to figure that out on your own.

also there's a weird bug where this only works on really empty sites
idk why but you'll have to figure this out yourself
